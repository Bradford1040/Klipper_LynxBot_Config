[verify_heater extruder]
max_error: 240 # double if needed
check_gain_time: 45 #default for extruder is 20, 60 for bed heater. increase for weak heaters. 
hysteresis: 15 #default is 5, this is the maximum allowable deviation from setpoint. increase during PID tuning. 
heating_gain:2 #default is 2. increase this for very fast heaters, decrease this for weak ones.
